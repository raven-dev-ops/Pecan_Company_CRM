# Backup and Restore Guidance

Issue link: #32

## Azure SQL backup/PITR expectations
- Azure SQL Database provides automatic backups and point-in-time restore (PITR).
- Restore window and retention depend on service tier configuration.
- RPO/RTO targets for MVP must be confirmed with customer expectations.

## Local backup scope
Local data that must be backed up:
- Receipt PDFs in configured receipt folder.
- CSV exports generated by reporting/export features.
- Optional local diagnostics/logs for troubleshooting.

## Daily backup steps
1. Verify receipt folder path in Settings.
2. Copy receipt folder to external backup destination.
3. Copy exports folder (if used) to same destination.
4. Confirm backup contains files created today.

## Simple restore guidance
### Azure SQL restore
1. Create a new database from point-in-time restore in Azure.
2. Update app Settings to restored DB endpoint/name.
3. Validate by opening Sales History and spot-checking known receipts.

### Local receipts restore
1. Restore receipt folder from backup media.
2. Confirm files are readable and naming pattern is intact.
3. If a PDF is still missing, regenerate from Sales History data.
